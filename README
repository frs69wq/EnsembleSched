This project is a simulator based on SimGrid of various scheduling
algorithms for workflow ensembles on a cloud platform.

Requires SimGrid (git release):
* http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr
* git clone git://scm.gforge.inria.fr/simgrid/simgrid.git
* 101 tutorial on the used SimDAG API:
  * http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/tutorials/101/simdag-101.pdf

The command line accepts many parameters:
* --alg <algorithm name>: the scheduling algorithm (currently only DPDS)
* --platform <platform file>: the description of the cloud in the
                              simgrid format
* --dax <file>: description of a workflow in the Pegasus format (DAX).
                Multiple --dax flags can be used
* --priority <random|sorted>: method to assign priority to workflows
                              (default value: random)
* --budget <double>: budget in $ (or any other currency)
* --deadline <double>: deadline before which a maximum of workflows
                       have to complete expressed in seconds
* --price <double>: hourly cost of a single VM in $/h 
                    (default value: 1) 
* --period <double>: time in seconds between two dynamic provisioning
                     of resources (default value: 3600.)
* --uh: upper utilization threshold in percents (default value: 80)
* --ul: lower utilization threshold in percents (default value: 40)
* --provisioning_delay: time in seconds before a started VM actually becomes 
                        available (default value: 0.)

Typical command line:
./EnsembleSched --alg DPDS --platform cluster.xml \
--dax daxfiles/Montage_50.xml --dax daxfiles/CyberShake_30.xml \
--budget 100 --deadline 10000

To obtain more verbose outputs add to the command line:
--log=dpds.thresh:verbose 
--log=dpds.thresh:debug
--log=task.thresh:debug
